# HacktobHERfest
SheCodesOKC is hosting our annual HacktobHERfest event again in 2023! This meeting is in honor of participating in the popular event, Hacktoberfest. 

# What is Hacktoberfest?

Hacktoberfest is DigitalOcean's annual event that's used to encourage people to contribute to open-source throughout the month of October. Most modern tech infrastructure relies on open-source projects, which are built and maintained by passionate people who don't have the staff or budget to do more than keep the project alive. Hacktoberfest is about giving back to those projects, sharpening skills, and celebrating all things related to open-source, including the people that make it so special. 

Thousands of coders and non-coders have participated in this event to support the projects they've used and loved, to learn and practice skills to enhance their careers, and to meet new people who love open-source as much as they do.

This year marks the 10th anniversary of Hacktoberfest, and they’re calling for your support! Whether it’s your first time participating—or your tenth—it’s time to hack out four pristine pull/merge requests as we continue our month of support for open source.
